# Prediction-Using-Decision-tree
This project involves the use of a Decision Tree Classifier to analyze the famous Iris dataset. The goal is to train a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal characteristics.
## Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for 150 iris flowers, divided into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
